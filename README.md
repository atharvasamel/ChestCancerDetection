# Chest CT Scan Image Classification

This repository contains code for a chest CT scan image classification project using an ensemble technique. Three CNN models, namely EfficientNetB3, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, were used to classify chest CT scan images into different classes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:
